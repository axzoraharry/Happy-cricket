The previous AI engineer meticulously executed the initial phases of the Happy Cricket platform, transitioning from a Node.js SDK to a full-stack, microservice-based application. The work began with detailed architectural planning, progressing to backend infrastructure setup (FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis), including robust user management, wallet, and initial betting engine foundations. Despite an EntitySport API credential issue, the engineer proceeded by building out the frontend (React, Tailwind CSS) and integrating advanced features like multi-gateway payments (Stripe, Razorpay playbook-driven), an AI voice assistant (OpenAI, Whisper, TTS from playbook), and a casino gaming module. The trajectory concludes with a comprehensive summary of a production-ready MVP, including Docker/Nginx for deployment, and the subsequent receipt of all live production API keys, setting the stage for the next phase of work.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Actual Cloud Deployment:** The infrastructure setup (Dockerfiles, , Nginx configs) is in place, but the actual deployment to AWS/GCP/Azure and domain setup (happycricket.com) is pending.
-   **Real EntitySport API Integration:** Although the  is built, the provided EntitySport credentials were flagged as invalid/expired. Real, valid credentials need to be integrated and tested for live data.
-   **Integration of Production API Keys into Code:** The user has just provided the live production API keys for Stripe, Razorpay, Google APIs, SMTP, MongoDB, and JWT. These need to be integrated into the application's configuration.
-   **Frontend Testing:** The user opted to test the frontend manually, so a formal frontend test by the AI engineer is pending.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed a comprehensive phase of development, transforming the initial MVP into a production-ready state. This involved:

1.  **Core Infrastructure Setup:** Establishing a robust backend architecture (FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis) with microservices for user management, wallets, betting, data sync, payments, AI assistance, and gaming. Docker-based production deployment configurations (Dockerfiles, , Nginx) were set up.
2.  **Enhanced Payment Integration:** Successfully integrated both Stripe (global) and Razorpay (Indian market) using verified playbooks, enabling multi-currency support, webhooks, and fraud detection.
3.  **Advanced AI Assistant (Mr. Happy):** Integrated OpenAI's GPT-4, Whisper (STT), and OpenAI TTS (from an unverified playbook), enabling intelligent voice commands for betting, balance inquiries, and match information, with multi-language support.
4.  **Mobile Application Foundation:** Set up the initial project structure for a React Native mobile application.
5.  **Casino Gaming Engine:** Implemented cricket-themed slot machines, a crash game, and dice games, along with game session management and wallet integration.
6.  **Backend Testing:** A comprehensive backend test was conducted (), confirming that almost all core functionalities (authentication, wallet, cricket data fetching, betting, payment processing, AI assistant, gaming) are working correctly, with minor issues addressed.

The current state is that the backend and a foundational frontend are developed with most features implemented and tested (backend). The AI engineer has just received all the necessary *production* API keys (Razorpay, Stripe, Google, SMTP, MongoDB, JWT) from the user and is poised to integrate them, moving from development/mock configurations to live production credentials.
